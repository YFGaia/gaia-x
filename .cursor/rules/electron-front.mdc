   - PostCSS v8.4.49 (CSS Processing)

4. Testing Framework:
   - Vitest v2.1.5 (Unit Testing)
   - Playwright v1.48.2 (E2E Testing)

### Code Implementation Guidelines

#### Architecture Principles
- Follow the Electron security best practices
- Implement proper IPC (Inter-Process Communication) patterns
- Use typed events and messages between main and renderer processes
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Follow the principle of least privilege

#### React & TypeScript Guidelines
1. Component Structure:
   ```typescript
   // Use functional components with explicit typing
   const ComponentName: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
     return (...)
   }
   ```

2. State Management:
   - Use React hooks for local state
   - Implement proper state management patterns
   - Avoid prop drilling through proper component composition

3. Type Definitions:
   - Create separate type definition files (.d.ts)
   - Use explicit typing over implicit
   - Implement proper interface segregation

#### Styling Guidelines
1. TailwindCSS Usage:
   - Use Tailwind utility classes as primary styling method
   - Follow mobile-first responsive design
   - Implement proper dark mode support
   - Use custom theme configuration when needed

2. Component Styling:
   ```typescript
   const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant = 'primary' }) => {
     return (
       <button
         className={clsx(
           'px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors',
           'focus:outline-none focus:ring-2',
           {
             'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600': variant === 'primary',
             'bg-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-600': variant === 'secondary'
           }
         )}
       >
         {children}
       </button>
     )
   }
   ```


### Best Practices
1. Performance:
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Use React.memo() for expensive components
   - Optimize electron window management
   - Implement proper garbage collection practices

2. Security:
   - Sanitize all IPC communications
   - Implement proper CSP (Content Security Policy)
   - Use contextIsolation and nodeIntegration: false
   - Validate all user inputs

3. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - Implement E2E tests for main user flows
   - Use proper mocking strategies
   - Maintain good test coverage

4. Accessibility:
   - Implement proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Support screen readers
   - Follow WCAG guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. Code Quality:
   - Use ESLint for code linting
   - Implement Prettier for code formatting
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Write meaningful commit messages

2. Documentation:
   - Document all public APIs
   - Maintain up-to-date README
   - Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
   - Document build and deployment processes

3. Error Handling:
   ```typescript
   try {
     await someAsyncOperation()
   } catch (error) {
     if (error instanceof CustomError) {
       handleCustomError(error)
     } else {
       console.error('Unexpected error:', error)
     }
   }
   ```

4. Logging:
   - Implement proper logging system
   - Use different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Include relevant context in logs
   - Implement proper error tracking

Remember:
- Always consider cross-platform compatibility
- Focus on code maintainability and readability
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regular security audits

### Requirement Understanding Process
Before implementing any solution, ALWAYS follow these steps:

1. Requirement Summary:
   - Begin your response by summarizing the user's requirements in clear, concise points
   - Use bullet points for better clarity
   - Highlight any technical constraints or specific conditions mentioned

2. Clarification Needs:
   - Express any unclear points or potential ambiguities
   - Ask specific questions if more information is needed
   - Highlight any technical decisions that need confirmation

3. Confirmation Step:
   - Ask the user to confirm your understanding
   - Wait for user's confirmation before proceeding with implementation
   - If the user corrects any points, update your understanding accordingly

4. Implementation Plan:
   - Only proceed with implementation after receiving explicit confirmation
   - Present a clear plan of action before making any changes
   - Break down complex changes into smaller, manageable steps

Example Response Structure:
```markdown
我来总结一下您的需求：
- [具体需求点1]
- [具体需求点2]
...

我有以下疑问需要确认：
1. [疑问1]
2. [疑问2]
...

请确认我的理解是否正确，如果有任何需要补充或修正的地方，请告诉我。
```

Remember:
- Always communicate in Chinese
- Be precise and specific in your summaries
- Don't make assumptions about unclear requirements
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding with implementation
